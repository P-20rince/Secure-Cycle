# Secure-Cycle
In this project I and my groupmates proposed a solution of bicycle anti-theft system.
Here in this, we proposed an idea of developing a QR Code to store the contact information of the owner and our branding.
Also we proposed an idea to develop a application named **SECURE CYCLE** so that we can store all the relative data of the owner and the bicycle provider.
